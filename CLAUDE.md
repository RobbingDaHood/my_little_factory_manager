# CLAUDE.md

## Build, test, and lint commands

- **Primary validation**: `make check` — runs formatting (auto-fix), clippy, build, tests, and coverage (80% threshold) in one pass.
- **Run dev server**: `cargo run` (listens on http://localhost:8000).
- **Single test**: `cargo test <test_name>` (substring matching supported).
- **Tests with output**: `cargo test -- --nocapture`.
- **Strategy simulation tests** (expensive, opt-in): `cargo test --features simulation --test simulation -- --include-ignored --nocapture`.
- **Coverage only**: `cargo llvm-cov --workspace --fail-under-lines 80`.
- Pre-commit hooks auto-run `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy` on every commit.
- All tests and coverage must pass before pushing. CI enforces ≥80% line coverage. Never commit known test failures.

## High-level architecture

- Rust web API built with Rocket, exposing REST endpoints for player action cards, contracts, and factory management.
- All runtime behaviour is exposed via HTTP; most functionality is tested with integration tests that drive the API.
- OpenAPI/Swagger enabled via `rocket_okapi`; view Swagger UI at `/swagger/` when the server is running.

## Key conventions

**Tests**
- Place tests in `tests/` (not inline in `src/`). Prefer integration tests over unit tests.
- Do not make items `pub` solely to enable unit testing — test through the HTTP API.
- Aim for ≥90% coverage before committing.
- Test driven development: Write failing tests first, Then implement minimal fix, then refactor.

**Code style**
- No `unwrap()` in production code; propagate `Result` explicitly.
- Zero Clippy warnings.
- Prefer small, well-named wrapper functions over long comments. Remove comments that restate clear names.
- Breaking changes are allowed and encouraged. Prefix the commit summary with `BREAKING:` and list what changed in the body.

**Types**
- "Everything is a deck": core state is modelled as decks of player action cards moving between Shelved, Deck, Hand, and Discard states.
- Use enums for closed sets of variants (`CardTag`, `CardLocation`, `CardEffect`).
- Use newtype wrappers (`struct ContractTier(pub u32)`) for unbounded but typed values.
- Use plain strings only for truly dynamic, designer-driven values.
- Return typed `Json<T>` from handlers and derive `JsonSchema` so OpenAPI stays accurate.
- Avoid `RawJson`; map domain types to serde-serializable structs.

**Features and dependencies**: follow existing `Cargo.toml` features when adding dependencies.

## Documentation maintenance

- **OpenAPI doc comments**: update `///` comments on handler functions and action enum variants when adding or changing endpoints. Explain strategic purpose, not just the signature.
- **README.md**: add new endpoints to the API endpoint table.

## Stream Timeout Prevention
1. Do each numbered task ONE AT A TIME. Complete one task fully, confirm it worked, then move to the next.
2. Never write a file longer than ~150 lines in a single tool call. If a file will be longer, write it in multiple append/edit passes.
3. Start a fresh session if the conversation gets long (20+ tool calls).
4. Keep individual grep/search outputs short. Use flags like--include and -l (list files only) to limit output size.
5. If you do hit the timeout, retry the same step in a shorter form. Don't repeat the entire task from scratch.
